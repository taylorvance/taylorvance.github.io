# TV Programs

This is my website. It is a tech portfolio and a showcase for my other creative works, including games and music.

It has long been running as a simple static site (VueJS w/o build step) on GitHub Pages. On 2024-09-17 (my bday!) I deployed v2.0 which requires a build step (Vite+React+TypeScript) facilitated by the gh-pages npm package.

## Installation etc

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:taylorvance/taylorvance.github.io.git
# install dependencies
npm install
# run the dev server
npm run dev
```
